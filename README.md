# Introduction

This was originally a machine learning notes share project. But for better portability I decide to write an e-book of this. 

For convenience, I prefer to assemble all the learning notes by markdown and all the math formulas are present with raw latex code (they are built by **Gitbook** with mathjax). 

If you have any problem about this git book, please contact me at aaronxia@foxmail.com.

Thank you!
