# Introduction

This was originally a machine learning notes share project. But for better portability I decide to write an e-book version. 

For convenience, I prefer to assemble all the learning notes by markdown and all the math formulas are present with raw latex code (they can be built by **Gitbook**). 

---

Since this is an open-source book, I have uploaded all the source code to github at https://github.com/vigilantee-seek/ML-Notes and it is hosted by Gitbook at https://ml-n.gitbook.io/project/. Of course with the source code you could build the docs locally in your PC with gitbook as well. The specific usage is as follows:

To use this document, you must ensure the presence of the following environments:

- node.js (gitbook is based on node.js)
- gitbook

Then under the `$PROJECT_DIR`:

```shell
gitbook install ./
gitbook serve
```

If there are any faults or errors in my notes, please raise issues and I will carefully check for them.

Thank you!
